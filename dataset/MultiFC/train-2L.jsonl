"Gov. Mark Dayton gave a late-season State of the State address this week. In it, he highlighted some of the bright spots in Minnesota’s economic, education and health outlook as evidence that changes made during his tenure are making the state better. PoliGraph looked at three of those statements this week. “There are more than 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota today. More jobs than ever before in our state’s history. 150,000 more jobs than when I became governor.” Using seasonally adjusted Department of Employment and Economic Development data going back to 1990, Dayton’s claim checks out: There are roughly 2.81 jobs in Minnesota today, and that’s more than the state has seen in recent history. It’s also true that there are about 151,000 more jobs today than when Dayton took office in January 2011. Of course, it’s important to put these numbers in context. The nation as a whole has been recovering from the recession for several years now. According to DEED, Minnesota went into the recession earlier than the nation and came out of it a bit earlier, too. Since then, the state’s growth has essentially tracked the nation’s growth. “Our graduation rate, nearly 80 percent, is the highest in a decade.” According to data from the Department of Education, 79.5 percent of seniors graduated in 2013 up from about 77 percent the year before “This increase is twice the yearly increase seen over the past three years, showing acceleration in progress for Minnesota seniors,” the education department said when it released the numbers. Minnesota’s graduation rate is among the highest in the nation. In fact, graduation rates everywhere are on the rise, particularly among Hispanic and African American kids. However, when it comes to graduating lower income kids, Minnesota’s rate is on the low side compared to other states – about 58 percent, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Education. “We have the fifth lowest percentage of citizens without health insurance coverage.” ",TRUE

"The 2015 session will be remembered as the one when Gov. Mark Dayton and the Legislature couldn’t come to terms on education funding. Dayton vetoed the education bill. Dayton wants $150 million more in the K-12 education bill to support pre-kindergarten programs in public schools. Republicans and some DFLers say the additional $400 million they put into education should be enough. Most of it is going to the per pupil formula. It’s an issue that has pitted Dayton against members of his own party, and underscores a fundamental difference in how many Democrats and Republicans view the issue of early learning. Many on the right say that, in addition to giving schools more money across the board, extra cash should be invested in early learning scholarships for low-income students, which gives parents a choice in where their kids start their education. (The funding bill includes money for this program, too.) On the left, many believe that to level the playing field for all kids, early education should be free and offered universally in public schools. This week, PoliGraph looked at two essential arguments on either side of the debate. The impasse sets the Legislature up for a special session to renegotiate a deal before July 1, when the new fiscal year begins and the state’s education department would shut down without annual funding. Republicans say Minnesota’s school administrators oppose Dayton’s pre-K plan. Dayton’s proposed expansion would be voluntary and for only half the day. Some school superintendents do oppose the idea. For instance, the Association of Metropolitan School Districts, which represents schools in the Twin Cities area, said universal pre-kindergarten “is a worthy goal.” “But our school districts need time to secure the necessary classroom space and licensed staff, develop transportation plans, provide staff training, and be prepared to serve pre-kindergarten students with special needs,” wrote AMSD executive director Scott Croonquist in a letter to House Education Finance Chair Rep. Jenifer Loon, R-Eden Prairie earlier this month. Instead, Croonquist’s group supports more funding for the per pupil formula – which is what the bill sent to Dayton includes – and higher investments in the School Readiness program, which serves 3 and 4 year olds who are underprepared for kindergarten. Similar views are shared by the Minnesota School Boards Association, individual administrators across the state, and even Dayton’s Early Learning Council, which suggested some of the money should be invested in the early education scholarship program. The Minnesota Association of School Administrators has a more nuanced view on the issue. Executive Director Gary Amoroso said his group supports Dayton’s call for $150 million more. But it would like to see much of it added to the formula, with an undefined expansion of early childhood learning coming next. Amoroso said he doesn’t view the issue as a divide between Dayton and the superintendents. However, some superintendents do support Dayton’s proposal. They include Julia Espe, who is superintendent of Princeton’s Public Schools. She wrote in a letter to legislators that “universal pre-K for 4-year-olds will help us with our core mission–educating every single student… Why can’t we provide this strategy to close the achievement gap when the state has a surplus?” Espe’s views were echoed by superintendents in Bloomington, Maplewood and South St. Paul, among other places. Dayton says universal pre-kindergarten in public schools will help close the achievement gap. At the core of Dayton’s argument is that expanding pre-kindergarten to public schools will give all kids a better start in life. Dayton has cause for concern. Minnesota ranks last among 41 states when it comes to access to state pre-kindergarten programs and Minnesota ranks high when it comes to daycare and pre-kindergarten costs. And the state’s achievement gap between white students and students of color remains stubbornly wide. Meanwhile, there’s some consensus among early learning experts that students, regardless of race and economic background, who attend high quality pre-kindergarten do better in school and in life, said Milagros Nores, who is Associate Director of Research at the National Institute for Early Education Research. Nores added that the effects are even stronger for low-income, minority and dual language children. But Nores said learning can happen in a number of settings, not just public schools, and still be successful. “If the experience is high-quality, then it doesn’t matter where the child learns,” she said. Some states, including Georgia, have an all-public approach, and the outcomes are good. Other states use a combination of public and private programs, and children are successful there, too, Nores said. Minnesota falls into the latter category, with lower-income children accessing pre-K with state-funded scholarships. Dayton’s budget preserves that funding, but critics say more money should be dedicated to those programs. University of Minnesota professor and early childhood learning expert Arthur Reynolds agrees that quality trumps location. But Reynolds also pointed out that many of the factors associated with quality – such as teaching skills and curriculum – are often found in the public school setting. “Many of these features are more common in schools, especially teacher pay and certification, but private centers can also be very strong in these areas, sometimes stronger such as in [lower] group size,” Reynolds said. “There tends to be more variation in quality in private programs comparatively.” Reynolds also emphasized access, particularly when it comes to pre-K costs in Minnesota. “There has been greater reliance on private programs, family -based programs but the need to build a larger more unified system is real and that is what the Governor is proposing,” Reynold said. The Verdicts Figuring out how to better educate Minnesota’s children is a politically thorny and complicated issue. And while there’s some uncertainty about how widespread support is for Dayton’s plan and whether ultimately expanding pre-kindergarten to all public schools is entirely necessary, politicians on both sides of the issue are making sound and reasonable arguments based on plenty of facts.

"In his fifth State of the State address on Thursday, Gov. Mark Dayton repeated a lot of claims about the state’s economy and future. PoliGraph put three of those claims to the test and found two of the three to be correct. Here’s Dayton’s first claim about Minnesota’s economy. “More Minnesota businesses are expanding.  So, more Minnesotans are working.  They are earning more money, which means they are paying more taxes.” Dayton’s talking about the state’s most recent budget forecast. The report showed that more Minnesotans are working and earning higher wages, when not adjusted for inflation. That means more income and sales tax revenue for the state, which is a big driver behind Minnesota’s $1.9 billion budget surplus. PoliGraph rated a similar claim from Dayton accurate in the past, and we’re sticking with that rating. Dayton went on to talk about how Minnesota’s employment rate stacks up against the rest of the nation. “Our unemployment rate is an unusually low, 3.7%…. Minnesota is the only state in the nation, whose employment rate for 25-54 year-olds in 2014 exceeded its pre-recession level in 2007.” Dayton is correct that the state’s unemployment rate is 3.7 percent – lower than the national average of 5.5 percent. He’s also referring to a study from the Pew Charitable Trusts that compared 2014 employment rates in every state with employment rates prior to the recession. The study focused on 25-54 year-olds because those are considered prime working years, according to Pew’s website. Dayton is mostly correct that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that has an employment rate that’s higher than before the economy tanked. But the rate change is only slightly better than before the recession, and the Pew study doesn’t consider it statistically significant. Lastly, Dayton touched on the state’s education funding. “A rank of 24th in per-pupil K-12 education expenditures by a state with the 11th highest per-capita income means that at least thirteen other states are making greater financial efforts than we are to educate our children.” Back in January, Dayton made a similar claim about Minnesota’s per-pupil spending, but Poligraph gave it an inconclusive because the most recent numbers available are a few years old. That means the latest rankings don’t include Dayton’s more recent investments in education, like funding for all-day kindergarten. This claim comes with another important note: Minnesota actually ranks 15th in per capita income according to the latest Census data. A few years ago, Minnesota ranked 11th in the nation. ",TRUE
